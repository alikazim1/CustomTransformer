GPT Language Model
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a simplified GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model. The model can be trained on a text corpus and generate new text based on the learned patterns.

Overview
This implementation includes:

Data preprocessing to encode and decode text.
A Transformer-based model architecture with multi-head self-attention.
Training and evaluation loops to optimize the model.
Functions for text generation.
Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
